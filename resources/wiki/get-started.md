Getting started with papyrus is very easy, right now there are 3 ways to set it up.

- [Install papiro locally (recommended only for development or testing)](./installation/local-testing.md)
- [Deploy as a github page](./installation/github-pages.md)
- [Ejecute as a docker repository](./installation/docker.md)
