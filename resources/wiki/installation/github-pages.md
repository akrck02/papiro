# Publish to github pages 🌐
---

The most common use for papiro is to publish it as a github page.

## Create a github repository
---

Create a github repository for your documents and [enable the github pages feature following the official guide.](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)

Upload you files to a directory called ***uploads*** inside your repository and install the [official papiro github action.](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/papiro)

This action will download the latest version of papiro, convert and index your documents, and deploy the website to a branch called gh-pages in your repository.

> ⚠️ Make sure that the actions can write into the repository and that the gh-pages branch is used as gh-pages branch
