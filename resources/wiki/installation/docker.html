<hr>

<p>For the sake of simplicity we will use docker compose in this examples, feel free to use whatever you prefer when configuring it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-docker-compose">services:
  papiro:
    container_name: papiro
    image: akrck02/papiro:latest
    volumes:
      - uploads:/resources/uploads
    ports:
      - 80:8000
    restart: always
</code></pre>

<p>Add your documents to the uploads directory and start the container using:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>docker compose up</p>
